# 🌟Hello!! This is Darkuz69's repo!!

This is my repository where I upload some of my random projects and passion builds. I started posting code snippets at [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/Darkuz_69) back in the day, and now I'm here on GitHub sharing full projects with the world! From simple console apps to full-stack web applications - that's character development! 🚀

## ⁉️ Who TF am I??

Hi! My real name is **Michael John Larido**. I'm currently a college student (**3rd Year**), taking the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I've started my programming journey back in 2022, and I'm still grinding till this day! 💪

This repo will be my place to share my projects to the world. I hope that whoever finds this repo learns something from my projects, gets inspired, or maybe even contributes to make them better!

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

- **SariStoreMS** - My biggest project yet! A full-stack POS system for Filipino sari-sari stores using the STEP'N stack (yeah, I made that name up 😅)
- Learning more advanced TypeScript patterns and database optimization
- Exploring desktop app development with Electron
- Building solutions that actually help Filipino businesses and communities 🇵🇭

## 💻 Tech Stack I Actually Know

**Languages:** C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Frontend:** Svelte, HTML/CSS (abandoned React for Svelte - best decision ever!)  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman  
**College Languages:** Python, Java, PHP (learned in class but don't really use them)

*Started with C, fell in love with problem-solving and algorithms, then moved to web dev!*

## 🎯 My Dev Philosophy

- **Build stuff that matters** - Code should solve real problems for real people
- **Keep learning, keep grinding** - There's always something new to discover
- **Share knowledge** - Help other devs, especially fellow Filipinos starting their journey
- **From console to web to mobile** - Always pushing myself to the next level

## 🔥 Projects I'm Actually Proud Of

- **SariStoreMS** - Full-stack POS system for sari-sari stores (STEP'N stack) - My biggest project yet!
- **CustomLinkedList** - My take on Linked List implementation using C++ (Part of CustomLibraryProject)
- **CustomBinaryTree** - Binary Tree implementation in C++ with my own optimizations (Part of CustomLibraryProject)  
- **PocketPal 💰** - Student Allowance-Expense Tracker built for Web Development course (2024)

*From low-level C algorithms to full-stack web apps - that's the journey!*

## 💡 Fun Facts

- **First language was C** - taught me to think about memory and pointers from day one
- Love solving algorithmic challenges with C++ (data structures, DP, recursion)
- **Abandoned React for Svelte** - never looked back! 
- I name my tech stacks (STEP'N is my proudest creation 😂)
- Building from console algorithms to full-stack web apps
- Goal: Build software that makes a difference in the Philippines
