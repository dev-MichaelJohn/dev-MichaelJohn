# 🌟 Hey there! Welcome to Darkuz69's Repo

This is where I throw in my random projects, experiments, and passion builds. I used to drop raw snippets on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/Darkuz_69), but now I’m pushing full projects here on GitHub. From console apps to full-stack systems—call it growth, call it character development. 🚀

## ⁉️ Who the hell am I?

I’m **Michael John Larido**, a 3rd-year IT student still grinding my way through code every damn day. I kicked off my programming journey in 2022, starting with C (yes, pointers from day one—what a ride), and since then I’ve been diving into web dev, data structures, and building systems that actually solve problems.

This repo is my space to share that journey—maybe you’ll learn something, maybe you’ll get inspired, or maybe you’ll just laugh at my code. Either way, welcome.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

* **SariStoreMS** – My biggest project yet: a full-stack POS system for Filipino sari-sari stores (built with what I call the *STEP’N stack*—don’t ask 😂).
* Leveling up my TypeScript game and learning database optimization
* Experimenting with Electron for desktop apps
* Building real-world solutions for Filipino communities 🇵🇭

## 💻 Technologies I Actually Know

**Languages:** C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript
**Frontend:** Svelte, HTML/CSS (ditched React for Svelte—no regrets)
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman
**College Grind:** Python, Java, PHP (know them, don’t love them)

*Started with C → fell in love with problem-solving → ended up chasing web dev.*

## 🎯 My Dev Philosophy

* **Build shit that matters** – Code should solve *real* problems for *real* people
* **Keep grinding** – There’s always a new tool, language, or idea to master
* **Share the knowledge** – Especially with other devs starting out
* **Keep moving forward** – From console → web → mobile → whatever’s next

* **CustomBinaryTree** – Optimized Binary Tree in C++ (also CustomLibraryProject)
* **PocketPal 💰** – Student Allowance/Expense Tracker for one of my web dev courses

*From raw C algorithms to full-stack systems—that’s the damn journey.*

## 💡 Fun Facts

* My first language was **C** – pointers and memory management humbled me early
* I still enjoy tackling algorithms in **C++** (data structures, recursion, DP—good brain workouts)
* I moved on from **React to Svelte**—simpler, cleaner, and honestly just feels right
* I like naming my own tech stacks (STEP’N might sound silly, but it sticks)
* My long-term goal: build software that creates real value in our society

**"From pastebin snippets to full GitHub projects—one commit at a time."** ✨

*Thanks for dropping by. Star a repo if you vibe with it—it keeps me grinding.* 🌟

Would you like me to also **tighten the intro a little** (less “throw in random projects,” more “curated growth journey”)—or do you want to keep the casual *“this is my messy lab”* vibe?
